(* val tree_string : ssmap -> string

   let s = tree_string map in ...

   Use a Buffer (extensible string) and a right-to-left in-order
   traversal of the internal tree to construct a string version of the
   map. Nodes are indented according to their depth: root is left-most
   with children farther to the right. Each data element is preceded
   by its integer depth. Right-most elements appear at the top while
   left-most elements appear at the bottom. This means elements read
   in REVERSE order from top to bottom and that mentally rotating the
   tree clockwise gives appropriate left/right branch positions.

   val remove_key : ssmap -> string -> ssmap

   Returns a new map without key in it.  The internal tree is

   leaf, it is replaced with Empty, (2) If key is an internal node
   with one child, it's left or right branch replaces it, (3) If key
   is an internal node with both left/right children, it successor
   replaces it. Makes use of findmin_keyval to locate a succesor as
   the minimum of on the right child branch.
